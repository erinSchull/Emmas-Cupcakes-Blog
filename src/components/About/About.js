                        Yes, my name is Emma. That isn't just some random name. I enjoy reading, writing, music, and TV. I enjoy baking and I might even start a "bake shop" sometime in the future, for those who live close enough to me... This just got awkward...
                        Well, I'm Emma... and welcome to Emma's Life
