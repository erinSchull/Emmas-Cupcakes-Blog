                    <h2>Review of Books vs. Movies </h2>
                    <p> Many great books have great movies to go with them. And other great books... well... not so much. This list is a series, in my opinion, of the greatest, and worst, book to movie comparisons.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>1. Divergent</h5>
                    <p>Divergent follows the story of Tris Prior. A girl born Abnegation but decidedly defected to Dauntless after discovering that she is a Divergent. If you don't know the story of Divergent then go read the book. It is good.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img" >⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie: <span role= "img" >⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: I think the book is so great and despite being boring or repetitive at some points I think it is better than the movie.</p>
                    <p>Movie: Don't get me wrong the movie is good too and I did see the movie first (not something I recommend always read the book first) I just think there could have been something slightly better.</p>
                    <p>The movie was good but the book wins this one.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>2. The Da Vinci Code</h5>
                    <p>The Da Vinci Code is the story of the Harvard professor Robert Langdon and his search for the holy grail. Now that is the shortest and laziest description ever but so much happens in the course of this novel that that seems appropriate.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img" >⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie: <span role= "img" >⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: The book for this story was really very good and followed the plot very well but despite that it was kind of boring in some places.</p>
                    <p>Movie: I will say this. It is a very rare occasion for the movie to be better than the book but this movie deserves it.</p>
                    <p>The winner is the movie.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>3. Holes</h5>
                    <p>Holes is a humorous story about Stanley Yelnats a kid who gets sent to a camp where all he can do, all day everyday, is dig holes, thus the title of the story.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img" >⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie: <span role= "img">⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: this book is funny, clever, and annoying all at the same time, kinda like my younger brother. It highlights parts of the story that aren't in the movie.</p>
                    <p>Movie: The movie for this story is, well, not great. It's funny but misses some key elements thus making parts of it hard to understand.</p>
                    <p>The book wins in this duo.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>4. The Hobbit</h5>
                    <p>Now I don't want to hear anything like "but there is only one book and three movies this isn't a fair vs." It is. Trust me. The hobbit is the story of a young(ish) hobbit named Bilbo Baggens. He goes on a great adventure with a bunch of dwarves (I think there are 12 but I'm not sure) and a wizard. That's about all you need to know.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie Trilogy: <span role= "img">⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: This is honestly one of my favorite books. It is one of a few go to books. It has a great story line and great humor.</p>
                    <p>Movie Trilogy: The first movie was good... and that's it. It wasn't very great.</p>
                    <p>The book wins by a long shot. A very long shot.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>5. The Help</h5>
                    <p>The Help is the story of a few black maids and the white ladies they serve. It is a very touching story.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: Very good and descriptive. A brilliant plot line and hard to top. Another go to book.√</p>
                    <p>Movie: One of my favorites. It's one of the few rare movies that are barely better than the book. It follows the book greatly and had a couple added parts that made it better.</p>
                    <p>The movie just barely wins this match.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>6. The Hunger Games</h5>
                    <p>The Hunger Games is a story about Katness Everdeen and if you don't know the story where have you been the last ten years?! Go read the books.</p>
                    <p>Book Trilogy: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie Quadrilogy (is that a word?): <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                        <p>Books: Good but not one I would read again. I read all the books once and that was enough.</p>
                        <p>Movies: They were alright. Again probably not ones I would watch again.</p>
                        <p>Don't get me wrong the books and movies were good but not great.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>7. The Giver</h5>
                    <p>The giver is a great story about a boy named Jonas. When he was chosen to be the new receiver of memory he begins training with the giver. It is an incredible story and if you haven't I suggest you read the book.</p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: It's honestly been  a while since I've read the book but I know I loved it. It was good.</p>
                    <p>Movie: The movie was so great. The writer took a great book from 1992 and made a great movie that follows the plot line. I applaud the writers.</p>
                    <p>This is really rare but the book and the movie actually tie for which is better.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>8. Hugo (or The Invention of Hugo Cabret)</h5>
                    <p>Hugo is the story of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Spoiler: he does't really hang from a clock like in the picture. If you don't know Hugo's story please read the incredible book by Brian Selznick. </p>
                    <p>Book: <span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Movie:<span role= "img">⭐⭐⭐</span></p>
                    <p>Book: I don't read many picture books but when a picture book is 526 pages long and full of hand drawn pictures I'm intrigued. It is an incredible book and great for a quiet day. Trust me, even though it is over 500 pages long it only takes an hour to read... unless you feel the need to study every picture... I do.</p>
                    <p>Movie: The movie for Hugo was great and had a great cast (Christopher Lee). I just wish it was a little more like the book.</p>
                    <p>In this pair I have to pick the book.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>So... this is all I've got for now. That's eight book and movie comparisons. If you don't like any of what I said I don't care. These are all my personal opinions. If you really hate what I've said then send me an email. I don't care. I hope you enjoyed my list. Consider subscribing to my blog <span role= "img">❤️</span></p>
