                <h2>Killer Cupcakes</h2>
                <p>So for a long time many people who know me have said that I have "Killer Cupcakes". (Don't worry, they aren't called that because they kill people <span role="img">ðŸ˜†</span>)
                    I have decided to put out my favorite cupcake recipe. It is a white cake with cream cheese frosting and a raspberry marshmallow filling. That may sound kind of hard but believe me it is not. Just so long as you have the correct measuring cups and things it isn't really that hard! (i think its lots of fun! ðŸ˜‰)
                    Just so you all know I did not make this recipe up. I got it from one of my mum's Betty Crocker's Cookbook. (If there is some copyright issues with this post let me know.)
                    Also, the picture on top is not mine but the one below is. (the picture below is a chocolate cake because I don't have any pictures with the white cake <span role="img">ðŸ˜³</span> but it is still looks quite similar)
