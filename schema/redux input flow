start with SQL file with the sql query in mind

then go to the (db table)specified CONTROLLER
    to create the function that will go in the
        reducer...

in SERVER make endpoint:
    app.(rest method)
    takes in params:
        endpoint url, controller.controllerMethod

in the REDUCER:
    check initial state to see if the 
    piece of state that you want to update is declared
    (if not, include it now you dummy)
        then declare the constant that will be your action.type
        which will be used later as the case in the reducer's
        switch
            write the function to be exported:
                make an axios call-- if there was a parameter
                in the endpoint in the server, write the axios url
                like: `/api/${parameter}` where the url parameter is
                the same as the parameter in the function invocation
                set the axios to a const variable
                use .then to hold the promise
                write the return which will update initial state
                (in switch statement)

            in the switch statement w/in reducer function
                we will write the case with the action type
                (the const set above the function)
                + '_FULFILLED' is included when the action has
                an axios call payload
                the case will return the Object.Assign
                with parameters of:
                    the empty object which is initial state.
                    state
                    and the piece of initial state that 
                    is updated with the action creator

FRONT END RENDERING:



mapStateToProps is if you need to access info from initialState in reducer

function mapStateToProps(state) {
    console.log("state from private", state)
    return {
        user: state.users
    }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { getUser })(NavBar);

in profile conditional rendering:
`${users.id ? 'href={process.env.REACT_APP_LOGOUT}' : 'href={process.env.REACT_APP_LOGIN}'}`
